
Quantitative  Evaluation or Analysis :


Quantitative  analysis  numerically  computes  the  performance of the tested algorithms and is used to verify and support the findings of the qualitative analysis. As compared to the  qualitative  analysis  which  is  subjective  among  observers, the quantitative analysis evaluates the performance ofthe algorithms which are independent on the observer's or human error [1].  


MSE and INTER were ole metric to evaluate segmented results. The three functions, F(I), F'(I), and Q(I) [2][3], evaluate results based on the homogeneity of segmented images. Intresed reader please go through the reference articles.
